# TODO

This document outline the tasks that are in progress or to be done in regards to development/design of the theme.

## Header Section

### Main

- ✔️ Reorder **Menu** settings and add headings as shown in [header.md](header.md)
- ✔️ Change **Mobile drawer background color/opacity** to **Drawer background color/opacity** (to support both desktop and mobile)
- ✔️ Add **Drawer color** setting.
- ✔️ Add **Menu items color** setting.
- ✔️ Add **Active menu item color** setting.
- ✔️ Add **Drawer padding mobile** and **Drawer padding**
- **Drawer position** support

### Fixes

1. Consider removing **Horizontal spacing** setting. It seems useless.

2. Consider removing **Mobile layout** setting as I have opted to have single-row header sections

3. Menu block should use main body font if font is not specified.

4. Mobile menu type should be removed/hidden for now, as there is only one type - drawer.
