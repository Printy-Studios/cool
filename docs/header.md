# Header

## Overview

The header section group is used to display most often accessed features of the shop such as navigation and search.

## Header section group

The **header section group**, not to be confused with a **header section**(without the 'group'), is a group of related sections that are used to dispaly the most frequently accessed features such as navigation and search. It is also the place where you will probably want to show your shop's name and logo.

## Sections

### Header Section

Header section is a generic container for all your header blocks. You can have multiple header sections, which allows you to have multiple 'levels' in the header that will stack upon each other. You can have up to three header sections in the header. 

#### Customization

The header section can be customized in several different ways. For example, you can change the order of the blocks in the section, and you can change the alignment of each block, for example `left` or `center`. You can also change the padding and height of the section. Blocks that hold multiple elements such as **Menu** or **Icon-nav** can have custom spacing. For a list and description of each setting and blocks, see the sections below.
